Eoin looked through the roughly hewn window of his tutor's circular stone cottage, watching his elder sister, Brienne, ride through the village gates on her jet black stallion. She held her head high under the heavy tangle of auburn braids interwoven with ceremonial feathers and bands. In the dull overcast sky, typical of the fading winter, the red and yellow plumes and the polished oak crossbow slung across her back burned the eyes of onlookers. And many in number they were. Soon enough, the entire village swarmed around her, excited to hear the news she had undoubtedly brought with her. Moments later, the crowd parted and her face broke into a haughty smile as a tall, powerfully built man pushed forward to greet her. There was enough commotion that nobody bothered to ring the bell as they might have done to announce to return of the chief's daughter from her quest, but, up here on this hill, the crowd sounded like a mere murmur and Eoin felt far away and disconnected from it all. He caught himself wondering  - and doubting - the type of reception he'd receive if he came bounding in on his stead. His daydreams, however, were cut rather abruptly short with a violent thump that racked his chest.
"I told you that if I caught you staring out of that window one more time, I'd flay you and leave you out for the beasts-"Kynthelig had returned-"what are you staring at this time, huh? Why do you think your father relocated you to the farthest part of the village-ah... Brienne is back."
Eoin ignored him and turned back to his rune work, mildly resentful. He knew that if he cared to look up at this moment, he would have been treated to a look on Kynthelig's face that clearly gave away his unrequited feelings, but his body was still reeling from the force of the fresh blow.
